This app has 2 screens. Main screen is used for showing securely taken photos. Camera screen is used for taking 10 photos and securely stoing them in Keychain.

Main screen looks empty if the user have not used the camera side first.
### Requirements:
* XCode8
* iPhone Device

### Future Comments:
In the camera view, some sort of view which shows app is working(Like first photo, second photo etc.) should be added. Also, some other view enhancements needs to be done.
